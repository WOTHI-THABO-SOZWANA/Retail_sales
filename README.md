# Retail_sales

Overview
This project dives into a retail transaction dataset with the goal of cleaning, transforming, and extracting key insights using SQL. I created a safe working copy of the data to avoid damaging the original and conducted a full breakdown of the sales by gender, age, category, time, and monthly trends.

1. OBJECTIVE:
	SET UP A RETAIL SALES DATABASE: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
	DATA CLEANING: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
	EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
	BUSINESS ANALYSIS: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.


2. Data Cleaning & Preparation:
	Duplicated Table: Created retail_sales_copy to prevent loss from accidental deletes.
	Missing Values Check: Identified and removed rows with NULL or empty critical fields.
	Data Type Fixes: Corrected formatting issues (e.g., commas, currency symbols) in numeric columns like price_per_unit, cogs, and total_sale.

Exploratory Analysis:
	Sales by Category:
		Total items sold per category
		Revenue generated by each category
		Category with highest vs lowest single sale

	Demographic Insights:
		Count of female and male customers
		Gender breakdown per category
		Average age of customers
		Grouping customers into age brackets: Youth, Young Adult, Adult, Senior

	Time-Based Trends:
		Monthly transactions from 2022 to 2023
		Monthly breakdown of transactions by gender
		Month with the highest and lowest revenue

	Sales Performance
		Average sale value overall
		Average sale value segmented by:
			Gender
			Category
			Year
			Age bracket

	Time-of-Day Behavior
		Sales categorized by time slots: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night
		Gender breakdown of sales by time slot
		Revenue and transaction count across each time segment

3. Findings:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	 How many of each category item was bought | How much sales from each category
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Clothing sold the most items overall, but Electronics generated the highest revenue.
- Beauty held a solid middle ground, strong in both quantity and income.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	HIGHEST SALE VS LOWEST SALE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHEST:
- Across all major categories, the top recorded sale value was consistently 2000
- Electronics had this high-value transaction four times, matching Clothing and Beauty.

LOWEST:
- All three categories have a common lowest transaction amount of 25, repeated across multiple entries.
- This could indicate a standardized minimum product price, discounts, or budget-level items that sell consistently across categories
- The frequency suggests 25 items are highly accessible or form a base offering in your product lineup.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Number of females and males | Number of females and males in each category
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- An almost even distribution, with a slight edge in female customers Male: 975 Female: 1012.

Number of females and males in each category
- Beauty shows a clear female preference, but the +49 gap confirms it’s not just unscientific.
- Clothing, while nearly equal, actually has a male edge, which challenges retail assumptions. That could signal an opportunity: are men buying for themselves, or are these purchases gifts?
- Electronics are also slightly male-heavy, but the gap is small—making it a potentially gender-neutral category for marketing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Transactions in each month
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- December 2022 is high in both transactions and revenue.
- September to December each year shows strong momentum, likely driven by seasonal demand.
- February 2022 had the lowest revenue and transaction count—perhaps a lull after January spending or pre-Easter quiet?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Transactions in each month per gender | Which month had the highest/lowest revenue
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- October 2022 wasn’t just strong—it dominated, especially among female shoppers.
- The lowest male revenue occurred in February 2022

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	AVERAGE AGE | AGE BRACKET
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The average age across customers is **41.35 years**, clustering around the Young Adult–Adult bracket
- Adults (45–64) slightly edge out Young Adults (25–44) in volume, marking them as high-engagement shoppers.
- Youth participation is lower, which could reflect limited financial independence or different shopping habits.
- A slight decrease from 2022 to 2023 could reflect strategic economic shifts, or changes in shopping habits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	AVERAGE SALES | BY GENDER | BY CATEGORY | BY YEAR |  BY AGE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The mean transaction value across all data is 457.09, a healthy mid-range price point indicative of broad affordability and category diversity.
- Practically identical averages, suggesting purchasing power is evenly distributed
- Beauty leads in average transaction value, perhaps driven by premium pricing or bundled purchases.
- Youth spend more per transaction than any other group.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	SALES MADE BY TIME OF THE DAY | SALES MADE BY MALE/FEMALE BY TIME OF THE DAY 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Evening dominates in volume and revenue, peak shopping hours appear to be post-work, likely due to browsing comfort and increased time availability after work or school.
- Despite fewer sales, morning transactions hold the highest average sale.
- Electronics are high in the evening with nearly equal amount from both genders.
- Beauty and Clothing thrive across all time brackets, but women lead sales in those categories consistently.
- The afternoon shows slightly reduced volume but holds steady in average sales—ideal timing for targeted promotions.


Final Conclusions:
	Customer Behavior:
		The customer base is nearly evenly split between male and female shoppers, with subtle preferences by category (e.g., Beauty skews female, Electronics skews male).

		Adults (45–64) dominate in headcount, while Youth (<25) surprisingly lead in average transaction value suggesting fewer but more expensive purchases.

	Sales Trends by Category:
		Clothing sells the most units, but Electronics generate the most revenue.
		Beauty punches above its weight in average sale value, signaling premium product appeal.

	Monthly Momentum:
		Q4 each year (Oct–Dec) consistently delivers the highest transaction volume and revenue.
		October 2022 (female segment) recorded the single highest revenue: R41,000.

	Time-of-Day Dynamics:
		Evening is peak shopping time in both frequency and revenue, especially for Electronics.
		Morning shoppers spend more per transaction on average, indicating strategic or higher-value purchasing habits.

	Financial Performance:
		The average sale value holds steady at R457.09, with Beauty and Youth leading spend.
		Sales decreased slightly from 2022 to 2023 worthy of further exploration to determine why.
